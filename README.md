STPA for Learning-Enabled Systems: A Survey and A New Method

## Description

* The control loop of running example using DeepSTPA  
This figure shows the control loop of running example using DeepSTPA. Each purple number denotes a component-wise control structure, 
while the yellow numbers show the control loop inside components. 
The blue arrows suggest that the component can delve into the control loops of stage on a functionality/activity dimension. 
The red solid line represents the control operation and the green solid line depicts the feedback process.

## Acknowledgments

* The running example is based on the [SOLITUDE project](https://github.com/Solitude-SAMR/UWV_RAM).
